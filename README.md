# Aikashka

Talk with GPT 3.5 model right in Discord. Powered by OpenAI's Whisper & GPT.

## How it works

Well, your voice is sent to the local Whisper backend to get text which adds to the room context.

Aikashka will respond every 10-40 seconds or by calling her(/him) by name.

When the time comes, a big prompt is being sent to the OpenAI's GPT endpoint. The answer will be strictly formatted.
Depending on the response, Aikashka can:
- say something
- write something in the text channel
- kick someone from the voice channel
- save some note for herself
- leave the channel

Note that she remembers only 20 last user messages and 6 her own responses, all in order.

## Setup

### Notes

I don't do pre-made binary. It means that you have to clone this repo, open it in JetBrains Rider / Fleet (or Visual Studio (/Code) if you don't respect yourself) and make some changes on your own.

TTS made using Tinkoff VoiceKit (well, it's really cheap and the voice is REALLY good).

FFmpeg is not required, because NAudio is better and more stable.

At the moment, I made it work for Russian language only.

### How To

#### Required

Rename `appsettings.example.json` to `appsettings.json` and fill all required API keys.

Rename `name_mappings.example.txt` to `name_mappings.txt` and map all user profiles that will talk with the bot.

#### Lore

Take a look at `systemMsg` in `Aikashka.Core/Generators/TextGenerator.cs` - first 3 lines. Change them if you want.

#### Run

Compile & run bot.

Run Whisper backend under `aikashka-backend/`.

Invite bot to the server and use `/go` command to join the voice channel.

## Commands

- `/go`: forces bot to join the channel.
- `/cum`: send message to the room context. useful if you can't spell properly some words
- `/state`: shows room context.
- `/clear`: clear room context.
